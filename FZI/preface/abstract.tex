We live in a time of rapid development of autonomous driving systems and the continuous deployment of the same systems in everyday life. This poses a large span of challenges, in order to make the systems reliable and robust in their deployment, much of this robustness relies on the information obtained through sensors from the environment. The pros and cons of different approaches for traffic lane detection will be discussed and the corresponding results compared, with an emphasis on the urban environment, where the challenge of detecting the lanes requires more consideration.
